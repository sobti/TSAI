# Mask and Depth Prediction 
## Getting Started:
1. To make model up and running in your machine ,please follow below instruction :

   - Follow the data set creation approch from the following link : https://github.com/sobti/TSAI/blob/master/S14-15/Readme.md

   - After creating the dataset copy the Modlular code from to yout directory:
   
   - Copy the final weights to your dirctory :
   
   - Train the model as illustrated in python code :
    
   :+1: To save the time on training , It is highly recommened to load the dataset in colab 
   
 ## Model : 
 
 To predict the mask and depth on 400K images , i have used combination of two model.
 
     :+1:  Denset - https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_densenet/
     
     :+1:  Unet - https://pytorch.org/hub/mateuszbuda_brain-segmentation-pytorch_unet/
